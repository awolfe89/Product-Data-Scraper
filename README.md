# Product Data Scraper

###### Inherit 10,000 products with little or no data? *I did!* So I built a handy little scraper to get the basics and have it put all the data into a CSV file for me for upload.

###### This code has been scaled back to basics but with this code I pulled down product title, weight, sku, stock status, specifications, manufacturer, price, sale price and more. 

###### This can also come in handy when needing to efficiently price compare across large product lines
